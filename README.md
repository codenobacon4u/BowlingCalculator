# BowlingCalculator
A simple program that stores a single player's score for a bowling game per frame. It counts up the score as frames are rolled and handles spares, strikes, and consecutive special frames accordingly.

This library was ported from Java to C# for use in the VR Bowling project that was used in a VR hackathon "Reality Hacks."
